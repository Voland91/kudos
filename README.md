This project was a recruitment task in some software house.
I've made it in ReactJS based on delivered graphic project (Adobe XD) and guidelines. 

In a few words: this is app which shows for active user list of posts containing information such as:
- date (how long ago),
- name of publisher,
- post text (with emoji, hashtags and mentioned user),
- kudos (personalized badge),
- group (office department)

User also can add new post with all of this information (only post text isn't required) and this post will be showed on posts list until F5. Users, kudoses, groups are based on database, where you can qucick add new records.


I used: ReactJS, Create React App, React Router, React Redux, Styled Components, React-Select, DayJS, DraftJS + plugins (counter, emoji, hashtag, mention), React Bootstrap, React Responsive, HTML React Parser, PropTypes, Atomic Design ande some FontAwesome icons as svgs.

To open at your computer clone this repo, type: npm install, then: npm start. Ejoy! :)
